This is an exact repeat of the qPCR from Friday, but using a fresh aliquot of water for preparation. [The plate layout/qPCR workup is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090302-1.jpg).

Results: Same as Friday. Fluorescence comes up way too fast and there is contamination present in in the water. Will repeat with a fresh preparation of the primer working stocks.
