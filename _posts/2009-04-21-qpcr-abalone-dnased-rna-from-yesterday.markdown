Performed qPCR to evaluate gDNA removal w/ 2x Immomx and SYTO 13. [qPCR/plate set up is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090421-01.jpg).

Results: The two cDNA samples come up as positive. No flourescence detected in any other gamples. However, melting curves look suspicous despite the fact that the "Quantitation" view indicates now amplification.
