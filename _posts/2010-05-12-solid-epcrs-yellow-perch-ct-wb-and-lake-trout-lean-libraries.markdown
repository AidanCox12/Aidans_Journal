Performed ePCRs on these samples from DATE, following the "full scale" protocol. A work flow analysis (WFA) run on these samples from the initial ePCRs/templated bead prep (DATE) revealed too many polyclonal beads, thus requiring them to be redone. ePCRs will be performed using 1.0pM (120pg/uL) of the SOLiD cDNA fragment libraries, instead of the 1.5pM (180pg/uL) used previously.
