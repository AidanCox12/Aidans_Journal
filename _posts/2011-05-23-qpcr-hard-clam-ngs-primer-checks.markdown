Ran a qPCR to evaluate a large batch of primers (40 sets) that were ordered per Steven, based off of the most recent SOLiD run (samples submitted 3/10/2011; see Dave's notebook for more info). Pooled cDNA (2uL from each individual; from 20110511) was used. [Master mix calcs are here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110523-01.jpg). Plate layout, cycling params, etc. can be found in the qPCR Report (see Results). The list of primers tested is available in the Primer Database and consist of SR IDs 1233 - 1312. For brevity, samples were only labelled with the corresponding contig number.
