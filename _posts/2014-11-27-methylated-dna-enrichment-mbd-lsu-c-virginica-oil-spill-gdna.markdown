Ran ~250ng of sheared C.virginica gDNA from yesterday's shearing.

Results:

Ladder used: O'GeneRuler 100bp Ladder (ThermoFisher)

The shearing is, surprisingly, very inconsistent across the samples. The target average fragment size was ~350bp. However, most of these samples are <250bp. The MethylMiner Kit (Invitrogen) suggests that an average fragment length of 100 - 200bp is ideal for short-read high-throughput sequencing, but we're going to perform a bisulfite conversion on these which will result in some additional fragmentation, further reducing the average fragment size. Will proceed with methylated DNA enrichment.
