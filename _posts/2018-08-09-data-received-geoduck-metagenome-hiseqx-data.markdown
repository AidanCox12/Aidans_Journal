Received the data from [the geoduck metagenome libraries that I prepared](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/wp-admin/post.php?post=3400&action=edit) and were sequenced at the Northwest Genomics Center at UW on the HiSeqX (Illumina) - PE 151bp.

FastQ files are being transferred to [owl/nightingales/P_generosa](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_generosa/).

These aren't geoduck sequences, but they are part of a geoduck project. Maybe I should establish a metagenomics directory under `nightingales`?

Will verifiy md5 checksums and update readme file once the transfer is complete.
