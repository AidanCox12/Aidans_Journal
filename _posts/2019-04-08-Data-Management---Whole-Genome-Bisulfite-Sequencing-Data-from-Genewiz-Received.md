Received the WGBS data from Genewiz that were [sent to Genewiz for whole genome bisulfite sequencing on 20190207](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/02/07/Samples-Submitted-Robertos-C.gigas-DNA-for-Whole-Genome-Bisulfite-Sequencing-Genewiz.html). These were from:

- Roberto's _C.gigas_ samples (need to find sample descriptions...)

- [Yaamini's _C.gigas_](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Samples/) samples

- [Shelly's _P.generosa_ samples](https://shellytrigg.github.io/38th-post/)

Transferred data to [nightingales/C_gigas](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/C_gigas/) or [nightingales/P_generosa](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_generosa/) and verified MD5 checksums. Have added list of files to [nightingales spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_XqIOPVHSBVGscnjzDSWUeRL7HUHXfaHxVzec-I-8Xk/edit#gid=0)(Google Sheet).
