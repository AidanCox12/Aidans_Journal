[I was tasked with generating some qPCR primers to analyze vitellogenin expression in geoduck](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/491). In order to do so, I needed to annotate a geoduck transcriptome in order to identify potential vitellogenin genes. I had [previously assembled a geoduck transcriptome](https://robertslab.github.io//sams-notebook/2018/09/04/transcriptome-assembly-geoduck-rnaseq-data.html). For annotation, I used [TransDecoder (v5.5.0)](https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki). The annotation was run on our Mox HPC node.
