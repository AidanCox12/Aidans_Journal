Using the _C.gigas_ cytochrome c oxidase (COX1) primers [I designed the other day](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/12/11/Primer-Design-Gigas-COX1-using-Primer3.html), I ran a qPCR on a subset of Ronit's diploid/triploid control/heat shocked oyster DNA that [Shelly had previously isolated and performed global DNA methylation assay](https://shellytrigg.github.io/12th-post/). The goal is to get a rough assessment of whether or not there appear to be differences in relative mitochondrial abundances between these samples.

I used 50ng (2uL) of DNA in each qPCR reaction. The DNA had been previously [diluted to 25ng/uL by Shelly when performing her DNA methylation assay (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_Z4entkvU5W_z_m6xlGimbOnNGMB_O9avqDgDWt6Xs/edit#gid=0), however I did need to prepare a dilution for sample T02 (control, triploid), as there wasn't an existing 25ng/uL dilution in her box:

- 5.54uL stock DNA (27ng/uL )

- 0.46uL H<sub>2</sub>O
