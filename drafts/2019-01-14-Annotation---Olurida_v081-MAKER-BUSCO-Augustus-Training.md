[I've previously run MAKER, followed by two round of SNAP gene predictions](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/11/27/Annotation-Olurida_v081-MAKER-on-Mox.html) and now I'm going to throw a BUSCO/Augustus gene training & prediction in the mix to see how it compares. In order to do so, I've followed [this GitHub Gist on using MAKER/SNAP/BUSCO/Augustus](https://gist.github.com/darencard/bb1001ac1532dd4225b030cf0cd61ce2) as a guide on what the process should entail.
