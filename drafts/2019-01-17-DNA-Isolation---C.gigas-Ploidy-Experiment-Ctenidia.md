Isolated DNA from the remaining ctenidia tissue samples from [Ronit's experiment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17mv8gMbmaldggA8Zf0RwBeNF_O4faY8dJFg31XO63K4/edit?usp=sharing)) (Google Sheet).

Tissue was excised from frozen tissue block via razor blade (weight not recorded) and pulverized under liquid nitrogen. Samples were incubated O/N @ 37<sup>o</sup>C (heating block) in 350uL of MB1 Buffer + 25uL Proteinase K, per the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA Kit (Omega) instructions.

After the O/N incubation, I processed the samples according to the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA Kit (Omega) with the following notes:

Samples were eluted in 150uL of Elution Buffer.

Samples were stored in "[Ronit's gDNA Box #1 (positions B2 - B5)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gp91BJ5g2W6c4r8UhGVc2UhQGdCHju72aZswpR-Qxpc/edit?usp=sharing)"  in the FTR213 -20<sup>o</sup>C freezer.
