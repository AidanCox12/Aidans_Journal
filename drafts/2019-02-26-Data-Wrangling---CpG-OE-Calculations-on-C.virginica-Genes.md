Steven tasked me with processing ~90 FastA files containing gene sequences from _C.virginica_ in [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/593). He needed to determine the Observed/Expected (OE) ratio of CpGs in each FastA. He provided this [example code](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hputnam/EastOyEpi/blob/master/02-Cpg-test.html) and this [link to all the files](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/bu-serine-wd/19-01-08/).
