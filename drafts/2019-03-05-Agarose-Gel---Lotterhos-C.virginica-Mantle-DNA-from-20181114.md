Checked DNA integrity of the _Crassostrea virginica_ mantle gDNA I [isolated on 20181114](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/11/14/DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification-Lotterhos-C.virginica-Mantle-DNA.html) in preparation for MBD enrichment. Detailed sample info and sample processing (including calculations for MBD enrichment using the MethylMiner Kit) are here (Google Sheet):

- [Roberts_2017AdultExposureSampleInfo](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cDLmp6jKf37gnPTwHDR07dNt-t3_jzGE2TC2afagouM/edit?usp=sharing)

Loaded 100ng of each sample on a 0.8% agarose, 1X Low TAE gel with ethidium bromide. Each sample was mixed with 3uL of 6x loading dye and brought up to 18uL with nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O. Gel was run for ~2hrs @ 100V. Used two ladders in a (failed) attempt to accurately assess gDNA size:

- [GeneRuler HighRange DNA Ladder](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ThermoFisher_GeneRuler_HighRange_DNALadder_50ug.pdf) (PDF)

- [GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ThermoFisher_OgeneRuler_DNA_Ladder_Mix_F100439.jpg) (JPG)

The idea being that the HighRange ladder would handle high integrity gDNA molecular weight, while the DNA Ladder Mix would handle any degraded DNA and/or RNA present.
