_Crassostrea virginica_ mantle gDNA that had previously been [isolated on 20181114](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/11/14/DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification-Lotterhos-C.virginica-Mantle-DNA.html) was evaluated for integrity via agaroase gel [yesterday (20190305)](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/05/Agarose-Gel-Lotterhos-C.virginica-Mantle-DNA-from-20181114.html). Everything looked pretty good, so proceeded with shearing in preparation for MBD enrichment.
