[Finished MBD enrichment on 20190312](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/12/MBD-Enrichment-Ethanol-Precipitation-of-C.virginica-MBD-samples.html) using the MethylMiner kit. Since we were out of Qubit assay tubes, I could not quantify these samples when I initially completed the ethanol precipitation. Tubes are in, so I went forward with quantification using the Roberts' Lab Qubit 3.0 and the High Sensitivity dsDNA assay.

Used 1uL of each sample.
