Well, these results are very strange. The thing that immediately jumps out to me is how "small" Emma's assembly is. My assembly has nearly _5x_ the number of bases as hers does (2.2Gbp vs 412Mbp). This is an enormous disparity between the two assemblies. I'll talk to Emma and try to get explicit details on how she constructed her assembly.
