I previously assembled and annotated _P.generosa_ larval Day 5 transcriptome ([20190318](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/18/Transcriptome-Annotation-Geoduck-Juvenile-Day-5-with-Trinotate-on-Mox.html) - mislabeled as Juvenile Day 5 in my previous notebook entries) using just our HiSeq data from our Illumina collaboration. This was a an oversight, as I didn't realize that we also had NovaSeq RNAseq data. So, I've initiated another _de novo_ assembly using Trinity incorporating both sets of data.
