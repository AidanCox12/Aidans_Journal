#### RESULTS

I'm currently exploring some options for visualizing this data:

- [Dot](https://github.com/dnanexus/dot): This is the current forerunner, due to simplicity and ease of understanding. Will probably be the fastest way to get some sort of information about these genome comparisons.

- [CIRCOS](http://circos.ca/): This is _very_ cool and designed for just this type of analysis. However, seems like the learning curve might be a bit steep (i.e. time consuming). I'll probably play around with this at some point.

- [MUMmerplots with ggplot2](https://jmonlong.github.io/Hippocamplus/2017/09/19/mummerplots-with-ggplot2/): Uses R to reproduce the dotplots that can be generated with MUMmer. I've messed with this and, although easy to plug my data in to, the results seems to be confusing. May need more time with it, though.
