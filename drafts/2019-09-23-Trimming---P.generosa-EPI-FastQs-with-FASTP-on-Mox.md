Steven noticed that the [M-Bias plots generated by Bismark from these files](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/408#issuecomment-534180697) was a little wonky and asked that I try trimming them a bit more. The files were originally quality/adaptor [trimmed with TrimGalore! on 20180516](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/05/16/trimgalorefastqcmultiqc-trimgalore-rrbs-geoduck-bs-seq-fastq-data-directional.html).

I decided to use some trimming software called [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp), since it had a lot of options (including trimming without the need for quality filtering/trimming, as well as being multi-threaded).

Looking at the M-Bias plots and the original FastQC assessment, I opted to trim the first 20bp from the 5' end of all reads.
