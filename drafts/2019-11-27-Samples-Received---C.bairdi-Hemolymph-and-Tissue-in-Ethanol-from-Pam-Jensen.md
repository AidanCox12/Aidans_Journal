Pam Jensen (NOAA) brought by a variety of hemolymph and tissues stored in ethanol to use for DNA sequencing with the new MinION (Oxford Nanopore) to help aid our transcriptomics work.

The box of samples was stored in FTR 26 (underneath the fume hood).

Pam will provide a digitized version of the sample spreadsheet, as well as column name explanations. I'll add that info here when I receive it.
