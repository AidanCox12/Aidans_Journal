Previously [isolated RNA on 20191125](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/11/25/RNA-Isolation-and-Quantification-Geoduck-hemolymph-and-hemocyte-samples.html) and [made cDNA on 20191126](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/11/26/Reverse-Transcription-P.generosa-DNased-Hemolypmh-and-Hemocyte-RNA-from-20191125.html) from some geoduck hemolymph and hemocyte samples that [Shelly asked me to run qPCRs on](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/763).

Ran qPCR with vitellogenin primers I [previously designed on 20181129](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/11/29/Primer-Design-Geoduck-Vitellogenin-using-Primer3.html) and [tested on 20181206](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/12/06/qPCR-Geoduck-gonad-cDNA-with-vitellogenin-primers.html)
