[Previously, I isolated gDNA from a _C.bairdi_ EtOH-preserved muscle sample (20102558-2729) on 20200108](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/01/08/DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification-C.bairdi-gDNA-from-EtOH-Preserved-Tissue.html) using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA Kit (Omega). Although the yields were excellent, the [DNA looked completely degraded on a gel](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/01/09/DNA-Quality-Assessment-Agarose-Gel-and-NanoDrop-on-C.bairdi-gDNA.html) and running that DNA on a minION flowcell yielded relatively short reads (which wasn't terribly surprising).

So, to test out whether or not the degradation was due to the inherent age/preservation method of the sample, I decided to try another kit for gDNA isolation: Quick DNA/RNA MicroPrep Kit (ZymoResearch). I also decided to try three variations of the isolation protocol:

- "damp": where the ethanol has _not_ been allowed to dry and homogenized with disposable mortar/pestle 1.5mL tube in 800uL of 1x DNA/RNA Shield.

- "dry": where the sample is allowed to dry (per the "FFPE Tissue" guidelines) and homogenized with disposable mortar/pestle 1.5mL tube in 800uL of 1x DNA/RNA Shield.

- minced: where the damp sample was minced with a razor blade and incubate in 300uL of 1x DNA/RNA Shield with 30uL PK Digestion Buffer and 15uL of Proteinase K solution at 55<sup>o</sup>C for 5hrs.
