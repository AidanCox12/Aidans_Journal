Isolated DNA using the [Quick DNA/RNA Microprep Kit](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ZymoResearch_quick-dna-rna_microprep_plus_kit_20190411.pdf) (ZymoResearch; PDF) according to the manufacturer's protocol for liquids/cells in RNAlater.

- Used 35uL from each RNAlater/hemocyte slurry.

- Mixed with equal volume of H<sub>2</sub>O (35uL).

- Retained DNA on the Zymo-Spin IC-XM columns for isolation after RNA isolation.

- DNA was eluted in 15uL H<sub>2</sub>O

DNA was quantified on the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 using the 1x DNA High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen), using 1uL of each sample.
