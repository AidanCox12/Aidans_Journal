[Earlier today I isolated gDNA from C.bairi 6129_403_26 hemolymph pellets](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/02/10/DNA-Isolation,-Quantification,-and-Gel-C.bairdi-gDNA-Sample-6129_403_26.html) and recovered decently intact gDNA that could be used for sequencing. However, I still need more gDNA, so will isolate that (and co-isolate RNA, since I'm going through the procedure anyway) using the rest of the sample using the Quick DNA/RNA Microprep Plus Kit (ZymoResearch).

Followed the manufacturer's protocol with the following notes/changes:

- Used 480uL of sample, combined with 1:1 H<sub>2</sub>O (480uL), with 4:1 Lysis Buffer (3840uL) and mixed in 15mL conical

- Flow-through was retained in a 15mL concial for RNA isolation

- Eluted with 45uL

I combined this isolation with the [isolation from earlier today](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/02/10/DNA-Isolation,-Quantification,-and-Gel-C.bairdi-gDNA-Sample-6129_403_26.html). I have updated that post to reflect this.

Quantified on the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 using the dsDNA BR Assay (Invitrogen) and 2uL of sample.
