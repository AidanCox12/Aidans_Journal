#### RESULTS

Qubit results (Google Sheet):

- [20200210_qubit_crab_RNA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17HLwzVKPzZlLTBzsrX5XH5t2E8WhztdMlIicPTjr50Q/edit?usp=sharing)

[RNA] = 7.86ng/uL in 15uL

Yield = ~118ng

Yield is very, very low, considering the amount of starting material. Yield is likely due to clogging of column, due to overloading.

Sample was stored at -80<sup>o</sup>C in:

[Rack 2, 3, 5](http://b.link/srlab-80C) in [Shellfish Box #8](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ax6C-muxUTXxFEtfWdswBvueLhmxZzmwZcO2ur-0q-Q/edit#gid=1794729843)
