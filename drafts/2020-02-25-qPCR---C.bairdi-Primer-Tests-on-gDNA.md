We received the primers [I ordered on 20200220](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/02/20/Primer-Design-C.bairdi-Primers-for-Checking-RNA-for-Residual-gDNA.html) and now need to test them to see if they detect gDNA. If yes, then they're good candidates to assess the presence of residual gDNA in our RNA samples before we proceed with reverse transcription.

The three primer pairs to test are:

- SRIDs 1774/1775 (40s rRNA S30)

- SRIDS 1776/1777 (allantoicase)

- SRIDs 1778/1779 (ubiquitin thioesterase)

Used 1uL of a 1:10 dilution of the [6129_403_26 gDNA from 20200210](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/02/10/DNA-Isolation-&-Quantification-Additional-C.bairdi-gDNA-from-Sample-6129_403_26.html) as template (equates to ~4ng/uL).

All samples were run in triplicate.
