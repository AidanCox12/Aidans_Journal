After deciding on a [primer set to use for gDNA detection on 20200225](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/02/25/qPCR-C.bairdi-Primer-Tests-on-gDNA.html), went ahead and ran a qPCR on most of the RNA samples described in [Grace's Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_J_eAYgR4ZwKKW_Uv1Fl7oMk9tl6ZdhPL7v_ka3CkTk/edit#gid=0). Some samples were not run, as they had not yet been located.

All reactions were run with 2x SsoFast EVA Green qPCR Master Mix (BioRad) on the Roberts Lab CFX Connect qPCR machine.

All samples were run in duplicate. See the qPCR Report (in Results section below) for plate layout, cycling params, etc.

Master mix calcs are here (Google Sheet):
